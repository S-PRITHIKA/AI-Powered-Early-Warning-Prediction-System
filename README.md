 ðŸŒŠ AI-Powered Unified Ocean Data & Compliance Platform

Overview

The AI-Powered Unified Ocean Data Platform is an intelligent system designed to revolutionize ocean monitoring, compliance management, and decision support.
By integrating oceanographic, taxonomic, morphological, and environmental DNA (eDNA) datasets, the platform empowers:

* Fishermen with early warnings and compliance insights.
* Researchers with real-time biodiversity and ocean health data.
* Administrators with predictive compliance and decision-making tools.

Key Features

Administrator Module

* Dashboard

  * Real-time incident monitoring (map-based visualization + live feed).
  * Historical archive with filtering and timeline playback.
  * Compliance status indicators with traffic-light severity system.
  * Analytics snapshots with interactive charts & exportable reports.
  * System-wide notification broadcasting (email, SMS, in-app).

* User & Role Management

  * Add, edit, and delete user accounts.
  * Role assignment: Fisherman, Researcher, Admin.
  * Fine-grained permission controls.
  * User activity logging & audit trails.

* Compliance Management

  * Upload and update fishing regulations.
  * Regulation versioning with rollback support.
  * Automated violation detection & severity classification.
  * Geographic mapping of non-compliance hotspots.

 Advanced Capabilities

* AI-Powered Forecasting: Predict biodiversity changes, pollution risks, and fishing stock availability.
* Predictive Compliance Insights: Identify high-risk zones and seasonal violation patterns.
* Customizable Dashboards: Drag-and-drop widgets, dark/light theme.
* Multi-Language Support: Accessible to diverse fishing communities.
* Offline Mode with Auto-Sync: Designed for low-connectivity sea regions.
* Multi-Channel Alerts: Push notifications, SMS, and email broadcasting.
* Audit & Security: End-to-end RBAC with JWT authentication.

Technology Stack

* Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Mapbox
* Backend: Node.js (Express.js), REST APIs
* Database: MongoDB (users, compliance logs, incidents)
* AI/ML Models: Python (TensorFlow / PyTorch, eDNA analysis, predictive analytics)
* Authentication: JWT, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
