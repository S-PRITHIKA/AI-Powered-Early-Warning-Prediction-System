Perfect 🌊 — I understand exactly what you’re doing.
You’ve pushed your new **folders (notification + SMS update code)** into the existing GitHub repo (`AI-Powered-Early-Warning-Prediction-System`) and now want to **update the README.md** to reflect the **new project identity**:

> 🌊 **AI-Powered Unified Ocean Data & Compliance Platform**

Let’s do this cleanly 👇

### 🧾 **Here’s your complete updated `README.md` (ready to replace your old one):**

```markdown
# 🌊 AI-Powered Unified Ocean Data & Compliance Platform

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Unified Ocean Data Platform** is an intelligent system designed to revolutionize ocean monitoring, compliance management, and decision support.  
By integrating **oceanographic**, **taxonomic**, **morphological**, and **environmental DNA (eDNA)** datasets, the platform empowers:

- 🎣 **Fishermen** with early warnings and compliance insights.  
- 🔬 **Researchers** with real-time biodiversity and ocean health data.  
- 🧭 **Administrators** with predictive compliance and decision-making tools.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🧑‍💼 Administrator Module

#### 📊 Dashboard
- Real-time incident monitoring (map-based visualization + live feed).  
- Historical archive with filtering and timeline playback.  
- Compliance status indicators with traffic-light severity system.  
- Analytics snapshots with interactive charts & exportable reports.  
- System-wide notification broadcasting (email, SMS, in-app).  

#### 👥 User & Role Management
- Add, edit, and delete user accounts.  
- Role assignment: *Fisherman*, *Researcher*, *Admin*.  
- Fine-grained permission controls.  
- User activity logging & audit trails.  

#### ⚖️ Compliance Management
- Upload and update fishing regulations.  
- Regulation versioning with rollback support.  
- Automated violation detection & severity classification.  
- Geographic mapping of non-compliance hotspots.

## 🧠 Advanced Capabilities
- **AI-Powered Forecasting:** Predict biodiversity changes, pollution risks, and fishing stock availability.  
- **Predictive Compliance Insights:** Identify high-risk zones and seasonal violation patterns.  
- **Customizable Dashboards:** Drag-and-drop widgets, dark/light theme.  
- **Multi-Language Support:** Accessible to diverse fishing communities.  
- **Offline Mode with Auto-Sync:** Designed for low-connectivity sea regions.  
- **Multi-Channel Alerts:** Push notifications, SMS, and email broadcasting.  
- **Audit & Security:** End-to-end RBAC with JWT authentication.

### ✅ To update your README on GitHub:
Run these commands in your repo folder:

```bash
cd C:\Users\prith\OneDrive\Desktop\sms
echo "Updating README..."
````

Then open your current `README.md` file, **replace everything** with the above text, save it, and run:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated README to reflect Unified Ocean Data & Compliance Platform"
git push
```

---

Would you like me to also add a **section describing your notification and SMS system** (how alerts are sent from backend → mobile → fishermen)?
That would make the README even more professional and research-ready.
