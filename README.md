 🌊 AI-Powered Unified Ocean Data & Compliance Platform

## 📖 Overview

The **AI-Powered Unified Ocean Data Platform** is an intelligent system designed to revolutionize **ocean monitoring, compliance management, and decision support**.
By integrating **oceanographic, taxonomic, morphological, and environmental DNA (eDNA) datasets**, the platform empowers:

* 🐟 **Fishermen** with early warnings and compliance insights.
* 🔬 **Researchers** with real-time biodiversity and ocean health data.
* 🛡 **Administrators & Policymakers** with predictive compliance and decision-making tools.
